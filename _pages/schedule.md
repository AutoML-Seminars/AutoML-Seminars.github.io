Title: Multi-Objective Population Based Training Population Based Training

Abstract: 

Population Based Training (PBT) is an efficient hyperparameter optimization algorithm. PBT is a single-objective algorithm, but many real-world hyperparameter optimization problems involve two or more conflicting objectives. In this work, we therefore introduce a multi-objective version of PBT, MO-PBT. Our experiments on diverse multi-objective hyperparameter optimization problems (Precision/Recall, Accuracy/Fairness, Accuracy/Adversarial Robustness) show that MO-PBT outperforms random search, single-objective PBT, and the state-of-the-art multi-objective hyperparameter optimization algorithm MO-ASHA.
