Title:

Challenges in Hyperparameter Optimization for Reinforcement Learning - Understanding AutoRL Through an AutoML Lens

Abstract:

Automated Reinforcement Learning has been gaining traction in recent years, but is still catching up to the level of understanding and tooling of AutoML at large. One issue in particular is that we have relatively few insights into the behavior of Reinforcement Learning algorithms with respect to their hyperparameters - how important they tend to be, how they influence training and how to best tune them. AutoML provides tools we can use to investigate these questions and thus generate a basis for better AutoRL methods. I will be talking about recent work accepted at ICML 2023 where we take a first step towards a better understanding of Reinforcement Learning hyperparameters as well as future directions for AutoML ideas in AutoRL.
