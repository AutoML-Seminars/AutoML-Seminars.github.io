Title:

Hyperparameter optimization and algorithm configuration from a black-box optimization perspective

Abstract:

Automated algorithm configuration and hyperparameter optimization are central AutoML topics. AutoMLers classically consider settings in which one has access to a dedicated training set that can be used to compare the quality of different hyperparameter values. In practice, such training may not be possible, e.g., in lack of a reasonable training set or in lack of time or other resources for training. In black-box optimization, hyperparameter settings are therefore typically chosen on the fly, i.e., while running the algorithm. This approach bears the advantage of adjusting the algorithm behavior to the specific needs in different stages of the optimization process. Dynamic algorithm configuration (DAC) aims at leveraging this advantage in the classic AutoML setting.
We will use this presentation to discuss similarities and differences between the AutoML and the optimization approaches, with the aim to highlight (huge, in my opinion) potential for jointly developed approaches.
