Title:

Open Source Vizier: Distributed Infrastructure and API for Reliable and Flexible Blackbox Optimization

Abstract:

Vizier is the de-facto system for blackbox optimization and hyperparameter tuning at Google, having serviced some of Google's largest products and research efforts. It has tuned millions of machine learning models and regularly services thousands of users over production-critical systems at Google. In order to operate reliably at such a scale, Vizier required solving key technical challenges in distributed systems, outside of regular algorithm development. Recently, we have released Open-Source (OSS) Vizier, a standalone Python-based package based on Google Vizier, to optimize experiments for users and benchmark algorithms for researchers. In this talk, I will discuss OSS Vizier's distributed system design, its numerous integrations with Google's AutoML ecosystem, and its default Bayesian Optimization algorithm alongside its collection of benchmarks.
