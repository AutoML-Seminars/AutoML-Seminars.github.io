Title:  MotherNet: A Foundational Hypernetwork for Tabular Classification

Abstract: 

Recently, Prior Fitted Networks, and in particular TabPFN showed how to train transformer architectures on collections of synthetic datasets to enable in-context learning of classification and other tasks on new tabular datasets.
Building on this work, we introduce MotherNet, a hypernetwork architecture that can produce a small neural network via in-context learning. This approach is somewhat surprising, since it provides an entirely new way of generating weights for a neural network, without backpropagation.
We find that the models created using in-context learning by MotherNet outperform neural networks trained with Adam using optimizer hyper-parameters.
We also find that MotherNet performs competitive with XGBoost, at faster training times and without any hyper-parameter tuning.
