Title: AutoGluon 1.0: Shattering the SOTA with Zeroshot-HPO & Dynamic Stacking

Abstract: 

AutoGluon 1.0 released Nov 2023 after 5 years of development. AutoGluon 1.0 introduces a major step-change in tabular modeling performance, achieving rank 1 on 63% of the AutoML Benchmark tasks when comparing all major AutoML systems. The performance enhancement is due primarily to two new features: Zeroshot-HPO which learns a strong general purpose portfolio of models to train on downstream datasets, and Dynamic Stacking, which mitigates a subtle but important overfitting problem in multi-layer stack ensembling stability. In this talk I will discuss the benchmark results obtained with AutoGluon 1.0 as well as the techniques used to achieve them and how they can be improved in future work.
