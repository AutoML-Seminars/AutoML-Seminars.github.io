Title: Neural Fine-Tuning Search for Few-Shot Learning

Abstract: 

In few-shot recognition, a classifier that has been trained on one set of classes is required to rapidly adapt and generalize to a disjoint, novel set of classes. To that end, recent studies have shown the efficacy of fine-tuning with carefully crafted adaptation architectures. However this raises the question of: How can one design the optimal adaptation strategy? In this talk, I am going to present our recent work on using neural architecture search (NAS) to address this question. In particular, I will discuss our findings regarding the trade-off between searching during meta-training and meta-testing time, which emerges in a multi-domain context like ours.
