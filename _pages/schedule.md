Title:

Multi-objective Bayesian optimization with heuristic objectives for biomedical and molecular data analysis workflows

Abstract:

Within bioinformatics, AutoML has been successfully applied to a number of problems such as molecule design subject to desirable properties e.g. antigen specificity or protein function. However, many bioinformatics workflows are unsupervised in nature, making optimization of their hyperparameters difficult given a frequent lack of ground truth. For example, clustering analyses aim to find biologically meaningful groupings of cells based on their expression profiles, but there is no single objective that will guide how to select hyperparameters to obtain such a clustering. To tackle this, we propose a method for hyperparameter optimization in the absence of well-defined objectives. In these cases, multiple noisy heuristic metrics are available instead that aim to approximate the true meta-objective, but it is unknown which ones align with the meta-objectiveâ€™s maxima. For example, in the clustering analysis mentioned above the meta-objective is impossible to quantify in a single way but it may be approximated by a multitude of heuristics: do clusters express known markers, are clusters well separated etc. Our method infers which heuristic objectives may be useful (align with the meta-objective) based on a flexible set of domain-specific desirable criteria and adaptively updates a scalarization function by upweighting useful objectives. We evaluate the desirable criteria using the properties of the posterior of a multi-output Gaussian process surrogate function, allowing the functional form of each objective to guide optimization. We demonstrate our method on the analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing and highly multiplexed imaging datasets for univariate input optimization.
