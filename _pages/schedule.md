Title:

AutoML Decathlon: Diverse Tasks, Modern Methods, and Efficiency at Scale

Abstract:

The vision of AutoML is to produce high performing ML pipelines that require very little human involvement or domain expertise to use. Competitions and benchmarks have been critical tools for accelerating progress in AutoML. However, much of the prior work on AutoML competitions has focused on well-studied domains in machine learning such as vision and language---these are domains which have benefited from several years of ML pipeline design by domain experts, which brings the usage of AutoML into question in the first place. Recently, AutoML for diverse tasks has emerged as an important research area that aims to bring AutoML the long tail of ML tasks beyond vision and language. We present the outcomes and lessons learned from the AutoML Decathlon---an AutoML for diverse tasks competition hosted at NeurIPS 2022. The AutoML Decathlon presented participants with a set of 10 diverse machine learning tasks, and were tasked with developing AutoML methods that performed well on a separate set of 10 hidden diverse test tasks. We outline the details of the competition, discuss the top submissions, analyze the results, and compare top submissions to additional state-of-the-art baselines designed specifically for diverse tasks. We conclude that the combination of existing efficient AutoML techniques with modern advancements in ML such as large-scale transfer learning, modern architectures, and differentiable Neural Architecture Search NAS is a promising direction for AutoML for diverse tasks.
