Title:  Hyperband-based Bayesian Optimization for Efficient Black-box Prompt Selection

Abstract: 

Optimal prompt selection is a key factor for good performance of large language models (LLMs) on downstream tasks. However, in black-box settings, where models are only accessible via APIs, automated selection becomes a combinatorial, gradient-free optimization problem with high evaluation costs. We introduce HbBoPs, a framework that integrates a structural-aware Gaussian process surrogate with Hyperband as a multi-fidelity scheduler for sample-efficient black-box prompt selection. By representing prompts through embeddings of instructions and exemplars as modular components, our surrogate captures structural similarities across prompts. Hyperband allows for adaptively allocating computational budget, evaluating prompts at varying fidelity levels, and strongly reducing the number of full prompt evaluations. We validate our approach on ten datasets across three LLMs and demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines and competitors. This work broadens the scope of AutoML by extending multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization, traditionally applied to hyperparameter or neural architecture search, to structured, high-cost decision spaces in modern NLP.
