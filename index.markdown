We are organizing a series of virtual seminars about Automatic Machine Learning (AutoML). The idea is to have bi-weekly, one hour sessions with a 40 minute talk followed by Q/A session.
The seminars are free and open to anyone. If you are interested in getting notified the details about the seminars and how to join, please sign up to the group listed below.

Talks will **not** be recorded in order to avoid that attendees would require additional approval to join, and to encourage questions during the talk.

We do not share additional details only to avoid spam, everyone will be accepted in the group and invited to all seminars.

## Signup

To get the invites for the seminars, sign up [here](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/automl-seminars).

Instructions to join the virtual seminars are available [here](https://automl-seminars.github.io/about/).


## Upcoming seminars

All seminars are happening on Thursday 4-5pm (CET), unless the description specifies a different day/time.
